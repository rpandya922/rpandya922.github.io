Also asks a lot of big questions about what it means to be moral or perfect; all-around a great show with great characters and an enticing story.  His Dark Materials  I read the original trilogy a very long time ago, so I don't remember many details, but this show has continued to keep me interested in both the world and characters.  Steins;gate 0  I would usually lump this with its predecessor but what makes this show great is not what makes the original so great. I love this show for its character moments, it was great to see all my favorites get more development and screen time. The end of episode 8 was more than enough to get me emotional.  Favorites/Recommendations Steins;gate  One of the rare time-travel stories to both have high stakes but be small-scale. The characters are all super lovable, and the questions it poses about what the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; decisions are what it means for the future have no easy answers. There are few stories I love more than this one.  Breaking Bad  Perhaps the greatest show of all time. Only after I finished each episode would I realize how stresed I was while watching. Great characters, motivations, story, cinematography, music. To anyone who's watched, I highly recommend watching Bryan Cranston's reading of Ozymandias as the season 5 trailer.  Better Call Saul  This show is a certainly not as action-filled as most shows I find myself watching, but that doesn't mean it's slow-paced. This show knows how to raise the stakes with the relationships between characters and how to make decisions feel like they matter. We know how it's going to end, but the journey is what's interesting. To top it off, some of the best cinematography I've ever encountered.  Avatar: The Last Airbender  Another contender for my favorite ever show. Even after watching the whole series three or four times, I always want to come back to it. The characters feel real, their development makes sense, their actions have concequences, and heavy topics are given the weight they deserve even among the levity. Despite all the action (which is amazingly animated and grounded in real martial arts), I think my favorite part of the show will always be the relationship between Iroh and Zuko. Their reunion in the 3rd season never fails to make me cry.  The Legend of Korra  It's gotten a lot of flack for not being The Last Airbender, but I don't think it was trying to be. In each season, we see Korra face a new political idea that opposes her own ideals and that of Republic City. In the end, the answers aren't always about defeating the \u0026ldquo;pure evil\u0026rdquo; enemy, but about changing the world for the better through the synthesis of different ideas.  Demon Slayer  Incredibly beautiful animation, even more memorable characters. A lot of shows want to talk about the power of love and family but this show actually delivers on why these things are powerful and help the characters overcome their obstacles.  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  An incredible show all around. One of my favorite magic systems ever, not to mention how well the action was always animated. The world felt real and lived-in, the characters grew during the series without you noticing, and the story itself kept me hooked to the point where I watched all 60 episodes in around 3 weeks.  Mob Psycho 100 (I \u0026amp; II)  I don't know how to start praising this show. The premise of a basically unstoppable superhero learning to improve himself mentally and emotionally is just so touching. The fact that Mob's greatest strength becomes his capacity for empathy rather than his power is a great message. The supporting characters are also a lot of fun and I love seeing everyone interact. The animation in the series is also unmatched.
