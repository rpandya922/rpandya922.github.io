His Dark Materials  I read the original trilogy a very long time ago, so I don't remember many details, but this show has continued to keep me interested in both the world and characters.  Steins;gate 0  I would usually lump this with its predecessor but what makes this show great is not what makes the original so great. I love this show for its character moments, it was great to see all my favorites get more development and screen time. The end of episode 8 was more than enough to get me emotional.  Better Call Saul  This show is a certainly not as action-filled as most shows I find myself watching, but that doesn't mean it's slow-paced. This show knows how to raise the stakes with the relationships between characters and how to make decisions feel like they matter. We know how it's going to end, but the journey is what's interesting. To top it off, some of the best cinematography I've ever encountered.  Favorites/Recommendations Steins;gate  One of the rare time-travel stories to both have high stakes but be small-scale. The characters are all super lovable, and the questions it poses about what the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; decisions are what it means for the future have no easy answers. There are few stories I love more than this one.
